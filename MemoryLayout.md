# Memory Layout

* When you have a program as an executable, it is a file stored on your disk. However, when you run the program, your OS loads the program to the main memory and starts executing the program. This means that there exist two copies of the program when you run it---one copy on the disk and another copy in memory.

* `Memory Layout` is the format used to exec a program loaded into memory by OS
